# Phase-2 — Operator Interaction Graphs

Phase-2 investigates meaning as an emergent property of
**operator interactions**, not isolated operator frequencies.

This phase builds on Phase-1 outputs and introduces
graph-based and invariance-driven analysis.

---

## Core Questions

- Which operator pairs form stable semantic structures?
- Which operators are structurally load-bearing?
- How invariant are interaction patterns across authors?

---

## Methods

- Operator co-occurrence graphs (segment-level)
- Normalized interaction energy (NPMI)
- Author-level graph construction
- Edge invariance measurement
- Systematic operator ablation:
  - CASE.DAT
  - VOICE.PASS
  - CASE.ABL

---

## Key Result (Short)

Removing CASE.DAT or VOICE.PASS preserves structure.
Removing CASE.ABL collapses the semantic graph.

Meaning is carried by **interaction topology**, not frequency.
