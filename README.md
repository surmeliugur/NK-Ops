# NK-Ops — Operator-Based Meaning Dynamics

NK-Ops is a research repository that studies meaning not as tokens or embeddings,
but as interacting linguistic operators forming a measurable semantic field.

This repository is part of the broader Token-to-Marble / Neurocosmology (NK) framework.

Phase Overview

Phase-1 — Operator Extraction & Baselines

Focus:
- Operator identification
- Segment-level operator statistics
- MSV vectors and tau classes
- Baseline distributions

See: Phase-1/README.md

------------------------------------------------------------

Phase-2 — Operator Interaction Graphs

Focus:
- Operator co-occurrence graphs
- Normalized interaction energy (NPMI)
- Ablation studies (CASE.DAT, VOICE.PASS, CASE.ABL)
- Author-level invariance analysis

See: Phase-2/docs/

Key Idea

Meaning emerges from operator interactions, not from surface word frequencies.
By removing dominant operators and observing structural collapse or stability,
the system reveals semantic load-bearing operators.

Project Status

Phase-1: Completed
Phase-2: Active (invariance and ablation analysis ongoing)
