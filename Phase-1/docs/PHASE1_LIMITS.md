# NK-Ops Phase-1 — Scope and Limits

This document defines **what NK-Ops Phase-1 does NOT claim**.

Phase-1 is intentionally constrained.
Its power comes from limitation, not coverage.

---

## Purpose of Phase-1

Phase-1 establishes:

- a language-agnostic operator set
- a deterministic MSV construction
- τ-class separation (NOISE / LOW_OPS / A / AC / C)
- SHAİ as a local semantic invariance metric

It does **not** attempt full semantic modeling.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

Phase-1 does **not** aim to:

- determine theological truth
- rank translations as “correct” or “incorrect”
- replace human interpretation
- model belief, intention, or faith
- resolve doctrinal disagreements

NK-Ops measures **structure**, not authority.

---

## Locality Constraint

All Phase-1 measurements are **local**.

This means:
- one verse
- one sentence
- one segment

Phase-1 does **not** model:
- discourse continuity
- inter-verse dependencies
- narrative arcs
- thematic accumulation

A verse is treated as a **closed semantic system**.

---

## Operator Coverage Limits

Phase-1 operators are limited to:

- negation
- direction (DAT / ACC)
- anchoring
- imperative
- tense / aspect
- abstraction
- evidentiality
- barrier / prohibition

Missing by design:
- rhetorical devices
- metaphor resolution
- irony detection
- emotional tone
- pragmatic implicature

These belong to later phases.

---

## LOW_OPS Ambiguity

LOW_OPS is a **holding class**, not a failure state.

Reasons a segment may fall into LOW_OPS:
- weak operator density
- narrative phrasing
- stylistic flattening
- implicit meaning without surface operators

Phase-1 does **not** force classification.
Ambiguity is preserved.

---

## Translation Sensitivity

Phase-1 is sensitive to:
- added commentary
- parenthetical expansion
- explanatory glosses

This is intentional.

NK-Ops measures what is **explicitly encoded**, not what is inferred.

---

## Statistical vs Semantic Limits

High cosine similarity does **not** imply:
- semantic completeness
- philosophical equivalence
- contextual adequacy

Low similarity does **not** imply:
- mistranslation
- incompetence
- bad faith

Phase-1 outputs are **diagnostic**, not verdicts.

---

## Cross-τ Comparison Prohibition

Comparisons across different τ-classes are invalid.

Examples of invalid analysis:
- NOISE vs AC
- A vs C
- LOW_OPS vs anchored imperatives

τ-class alignment is a **hard prerequisite**.

---

## Determinism Trade-off

Phase-1 is fully deterministic.

This ensures:
- reproducibility
- auditability
- transparency

But sacrifices:
- adaptability
- contextual learning
- emergent interpretation

No neural inference is used.

---

## Why These Limits Matter

Phase-1 is designed to answer one question reliably:

> *Is the semantic operator structure preserved?*

Any question beyond this scope is **out of phase**.

---

## Forward Compatibility

All Phase-1 outputs are designed to be:
- reusable
- composable
- extensible

Later phases may add:
- discourse fields
- inter-segment coupling
- temporal semantic flow
- belief-state modeling

Without breaking Phase-1 results.

---

## Scientific Position

Phase-1 is:

- falsifiable
- conservative
- modular
- intentionally incomplete

This is not a weakness.

It is the foundation.
