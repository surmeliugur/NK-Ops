# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document addresses common misunderstandings about NK-Ops.

If a question is not answered here, it is likely outside the system’s scope.

---

## Is NK-Ops an AI model?

No.

NK-Ops does not learn, generate, predict, or optimize.
It has no parameters, no training loop, and no gradients.

It is a deterministic measurement system.

---

## Is NK-Ops a Large Language Model (LLM)?

No.

NK-Ops does not use embeddings, attention, transformers, or probability-based decoding.
It does not model language statistically.

It operates on explicit semantic operators.

---

## Does NK-Ops “understand” text?

No.

NK-Ops does not claim understanding.
It measures **structural meaning signals**, not subjective interpretation.

Understanding is a human act.
NK-Ops provides instruments, not conclusions.

---

## Is NK-Ops a religious or theological system?

No.

NK-Ops does not evaluate truth, belief, faith, or doctrine.
It does not judge correctness of interpretations.

Religious texts were used because they provide:
- dense operator structures
- high translation diversity
- long interpretive history

The same system is applied to novels and secular texts.

---

## Is NK-Ops a form of tafsir or commentary?

No.

NK-Ops does not explain meaning.
It does not propose interpretations.

It only measures:
- operator presence
- operator dominance
- structural consistency
- meaning drift

Interpretation remains external.

---

## Does NK-Ops favor certain authors or translations?

No.

NK-Ops does not rank authors by quality or correctness.
Differences emerge from operator density and structure only.

All results are reproducible from the same input text.

---

## What does LOW_OPS mean?

LOW_OPS indicates texts with:
- weak or sparse operator signals
- narrative or descriptive dominance
- limited directional or imperative force

LOW_OPS is not an error state.
It is a valid structural category.

---

## Is NOISE a judgment on text quality?

No.

NOISE means:
- insufficient operator signal for classification
- ambiguity beyond threshold
- absence of measurable structure

NOISE is a measurement outcome, not a critique.

---

## Can NK-Ops be wrong?

Yes.

NK-Ops can fail when:
- operators are poorly defined
- language-specific artifacts dominate
- segmentation is faulty
- thresholds are miscalibrated

This is expected and measurable.

---

## Why not just use an LLM for this?

LLMs generate plausible language.
NK-Ops measures structural meaning.

They solve different problems.

NK-Ops is designed to operate where:
- explainability matters
- reproducibility is required
- claims must be auditable
- learning is undesirable

---

## Can NK-Ops be used together with LLMs?

Yes, externally.

NK-Ops can:
- pre-filter texts
- score meaning stability
- constrain generation
- audit outputs

NK-Ops itself does not integrate learning components.

---

## Is NK-Ops language-independent?

The operator core is language-agnostic.
Language adapters are explicit and replaceable.

Language rules are not hidden inside the system.

---

## Is NK-Ops finished?

No.

Phase 1 is complete.
Later phases are optional, experimental, and revocable.

No future phase is assumed to succeed.

---

## What problem is NK-Ops actually solving?

NK-Ops answers one question:

> “Is there a measurable, stable structure of meaning here?”

It does not answer:
- what the meaning should be
- whether it is true
- whether it is good or bad

Those questions belong elsewhere.

---

## Who is NK-Ops for?

- Researchers
- Linguists
- Text analysts
- AI safety and evaluation work
- Anyone needing inspectable meaning measurements

It is not designed for casual users.

---

## Final clarification

NK-Ops is not ambitious by design.

Its strength is not intelligence,
but **constraint**.
