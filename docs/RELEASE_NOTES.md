# Release Notes — NK-Ops

## v0.4 — Author Stress Response & Clustering

This release marks the first **result-complete** milestone of the NK-Ops project.

### Highlights

- Completed ayah-level stress experiments for **46 authors**
- Stress parameters tested: `s = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8`
- Deterministic operator-response engine
- Author-level divergence profiles constructed
- Stress-response curves clustered into **3 stable behavioral classes**
- Mean and cluster visualizations generated

### Artifacts

- `author-profile.tsv`
- `author-profile-clustered.tsv`
- `author_stress_response_mean.png`
- `author_stress_response_clusters.png`

### Significance

This release demonstrates that:

- Semantic stress induces **structured divergence**
- Author behavior under stress is **measurable and classifiable**
- Results are independent of embeddings or probabilistic models

This establishes NK-Ops as a valid experimental framework for **meaning-centric analysis**.

Next steps will focus on:
- Operator taxonomy expansion
- Cross-corpus validation
- Integration with NK field-theoretic models
