# NK-Ops — Core Semantic Operators (Phase-1)

This document defines the **language-independent core operators** of NK-Ops Phase-1.

Operators are not grammatical labels.
They are **semantic forces** acting on meaning-space.

Each operator contributes a vector component to the **Marble State Vector (MSV)**.

---

## Operator Philosophy

NK-Ops does not ask:
> *What does this word mean?*

It asks:
> *What does this expression **do** to meaning?*

Operators are therefore:
- Functional
- Directional
- Measurable
- Comparable across translations and texts

They are extracted from surface language, but **do not belong to any single language**.

---

## Operator Categories

Phase-1 defines operators in six functional groups:

1. Anchoring
2. Direction
3. Invocation
4. Negation
5. Temporal / Evidential
6. Barrier / Prohibition

---

## 1. Anchor Operator (`anchor`)

**Function:** Ontological stabilization

**Semantic Role:**  
Fixes a statement as a claim, rule, or asserted reality.

**Effect on MSV:**
- Increases semantic mass
- Reduces interpretive drift

**Typical Linguistic Sources (language-specific adapters):**
- Copular constructions
- Definitive assertions
- “is / are / -dır / indeed”

**Interpretation:**  
> *This is being stated as real, binding, or valid.*

---

## 2. Direction Operators

### 2.1 Dative Direction (`dat`)

**Function:** Target orientation

**Semantic Role:**  
Directs meaning toward a recipient, goal, or endpoint.

**Effect on MSV:**
- Introduces vector orientation
- Enables C-regime activation

**Interpretation:**  
> *Meaning is aimed toward someone or something.*

---

### 2.2 Accusative Direction (`acc`)

**Function:** Object focus

**Semantic Role:**  
Defines what meaning acts upon.

**Effect on MSV:**
- Sharpens semantic focus
- Increases action specificity

**Interpretation:**  
> *This is what the action is about.*

---

## 3. Invocation Operator (`invoke`)

**Function:** Semantic calling

**Semantic Role:**  
Explicitly opens a channel to an addressee.

**Effect on MSV:**
- Strongly increases C-component
- Raises intentional intensity

**Interpretation:**  
> *An address, call, or appeal is being made.*

---

## 4. Negation Operator (`neg`)

**Function:** State cancellation

**Semantic Role:**  
Denies, excludes, or nullifies a semantic state.

**Effect on MSV:**
- Introduces polarity inversion
- Can suppress or reverse vectors

**Interpretation:**  
> *This state is explicitly rejected.*

---

## 5. Temporal & Evidential Operators

### 5.1 Past (`past`)

**Function:** Event grounding

**Semantic Role:**  
Anchors meaning to completed events.

---

### 5.2 Evidential (`evid`)

**Function:** Knowledge mode marking

**Semantic Role:**  
Indicates reported, inferred, or indirect knowledge.

---

### 5.3 Future (`fut`)

**Function:** Projection

**Semantic Role:**  
Pushes meaning into unrealized or expected states.

---

### 5.4 Progressive (`prog`)

**Function:** Process continuation

**Semantic Role:**  
Marks ongoing or unfolding states.

---

## 6. Abstraction Operator (`abst`)

**Function:** Conceptual elevation

**Semantic Role:**  
Transforms concrete expressions into abstract entities.

**Effect on MSV:**
- Increases dimensional generality
- Reduces situational dependency

---

## 7. Imperative Operator (`imp`)

**Function:** Force injection

**Semantic Role:**  
Applies direct pressure toward action.

**Effect on MSV:**
- Strong C-regime activation
- Overrides descriptive balance

**Interpretation:**  
> *This is not being described — it is being demanded.*

---

## 8. Barrier Operator (`barrier`)

**Function:** Constraint enforcement

**Semantic Role:**  
Blocks, forbids, or restricts semantic transitions.

**Effect on MSV:**
- Introduces hard limits
- Prevents trajectory continuation

**Interpretation:**  
> *This path is closed.*

---

## Operator Detection vs. Language

Operators are **detected**, not translated.

Each language adapter maps surface forms to these operators, but:
- Operators themselves remain unchanged
- MSV computation is language-independent

This allows:
- Cross-translation comparison
- Cross-text analysis
- Cross-language semantic physics

---

## Phase-1 Constraints

Phase-1 operators are intentionally minimal.

They are chosen because they:
- Appear consistently across texts
- Produce stable MSV behavior
- Survive translation variance

No new operator may be added in Phase-1
without invalidating previous results.

---

## Summary

- Operators are **semantic forces**
- They act on meaning, not words
- MSV emerges from their interaction
- Language adapters are replaceable
- NK-Ops core is invariant
